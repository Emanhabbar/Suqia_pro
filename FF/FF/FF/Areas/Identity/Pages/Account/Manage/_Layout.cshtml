    Areas/Identity/Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml

    This layout file is used by all Identity Razor Pages.
    We are making it use the main application's _Layout.cshtml to ensure consistent styling.

@{
    // Set the layout to use the main application's _Layout.cshtml
    // Ensure this path is correct relative to the root of your project
    Layout = "/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}

@*
    The content of this file will be rendered inside the RenderBody() of the main _Layout.cshtml.
    You can add specific styling or wrappers here if needed for Identity pages,
    but for now, we'll let the individual Identity pages handle their content.
